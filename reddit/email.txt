Hi,

Here are the matlab scripts that I used to process your data. These succeed at outputting pseudoranges estimates for 6 satellites for the full duration of the flight, until 180 secs into the dataset (8 satellites also work, but the last two are somewhat noisy).

However, the scripts only extract the pseudoranges, and does not do anything with them.  Do you have or know of a program which can process RINEX observation files into position fixes?  If you do, I will write the script that generates such a file.  If not, I can also write a matlab script to compute position fixes directly from the pseudoranges, but that implies a bit more work, so I would rather use the first option if possible.

Also please note that the scripts are very messy right now and somewhat customized to your dataset, they're not really a general tool for GNSS processing (although they could be cleaned up eventually).

Let me know if there's any issue.  The main script to run is "gps_process_2.m".  You should only have to change the filenames in "gps_process_2.m" and "load_rinex_observation.m".
